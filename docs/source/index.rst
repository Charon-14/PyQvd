`PyQvd <https://github.com/MuellerConstantin/PyQvd.git>`_ is a Python library that provides a simple
API for reading/writing Qlik View Data (QVD) files in Python. Using this library, it is possible
to parse the binary QVD file format and convert it to a Python object structure or vice versa.

In general, PyQvd is designed to be simple and easy to use. The library provides a high-level API that
allows you to read and write QVD files with just a few lines of code. This way, you can focus on your
data analysis tasks without having to worry about the details of the QVD file format.

PyQvd is a pure Python library and does not require any additional dependencies in order to work. However,
some features of this library, especially connectors to third-party data sources, may require external
libraries like `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_. If you want to use these features, you need to
install the required libraries manually.
