API Reference
=============

This part of the documentation covers all the public classes and functions of
the PyQvd library. It is organized into a couple of sections:

- :ref:`core`: The core functionality of PyQvd.
- :ref:`io`: Input/output operations with QVD files.

.. important::

    Only the public API is documented here. If you are looking for information
    on a specific class or function, but it is not listed here, it is probably
    a private API. Private APIs are subject to change without notice, and
    should not be used in your code.
